# FitExpFunction
Contains a simple function for performing exponential fit.
The idea is to practice writing a simple python program and compare performance with the corresponding numpy function.
The program file includes function to create noisy data, exponential fit using my function and corresponding fit using numpy 
The noise function is not Gaussian, it is simply a random noise generator.
